<h5>Everybody Hello </h5>

I will present you a small image processing study I did in a school study.


The system allocates as many threads as the number of cores in your computer and shares the works of the herbaceous equation, so we see that it performs the herbaceous equation 4 times faster for a 4-core computer.

You can also download it to the project and predict the importance of threads.



In order to understand the difference in the best way, I give the time to the screen for information.


Thank you for reading, you can access the project from my github account.
